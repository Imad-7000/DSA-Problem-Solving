//In the lively town of Main Street, two HeyCoach students, Ram and Shyam, embarked on an intriguing challenge
//Tasked by their mentor, they ventured onto a straight road lined with an even number of buildings
//Each building held a stash of gold coins, but here's the twist â€“ certain buildings were occupied by cunning thieves
//who could pilfer coins from their pockets.
//Ram kicked off the adventure from the 0th building, while Shyam began at the (n-1)th building,
//both determined to maximize their gold haul. Guided by their mentor's strategy, they aimed to visit n/2 buildings,
//ensuring they'd eventually meet in the middle.
//
//You have to return an array of size `n/2` where ith index would denote who has the maximum number
// of coins collected at ith time.
//
//1 if Ram has maximum coins, -1 if Shyam has maximum coins, 0 if both have same number of coins.
//
//Example 1
//Input: [1,2,-1,4,-1,1]
//Output: [0,1,-1]
//
//Example 2
//Input: [1,-1]
//Output:  [1]
